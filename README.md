# CopyClipboard
This program for take data from cilpboard and past to clipboard.txt file.

## How To Work

When you run the script, script creats two txt files named clipboard.txt and hash.txt. 
Script takes the copied text from clipboard and creats the hash of the text and compares 
the last hash with the current one. If the two of them are the same, script doesn't do anything.
But if they aren't the same, script adds the current text to the clipboard.txt and its hash to the hash.txt.
